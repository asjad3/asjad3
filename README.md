# hi 😃

i'm asjad, and i build stuff that makes me go "wait, can i actually pull this off?" (spoiler: sometimes)

## what i'm into

- making things that probably shouldn't work but somehow do
- hackathons 
- systems that are smarter than me 

## stuff i've built

**CampusTrust** - threw this together for the NUST Olympiad Hackathon. it's basically an anonymous rumor verification system because apparently we needed blockchain energy but for campus gossip? uses bayesian inference, cryptographic anonymity, game theory... you know, the casual stuff. has voting, trust scores, bot detection, the works. 

probably got some repos i started at 2am and forgot about. the graveyard of "i'll finish this later" is real.

got side projects in:
- machine learning stuff (because who doesn't these days)
- web dev experiments
- random scripts that solve very specific problems i had once
- things i built to learn and then never touched again

*if you're reading this and we worked on something together, yes i remember, yes it's here somewhere, yes i need to update this section*



## currently

probably debugging something that worked yesterday, or starting a new project before finishing the last three.

## hit me up

if you want to talk about cool projects, weird ideas, or why your code isn't working (i probably don't know either but we can figure it out together)
